# LetterForJesse_CYOA
Letter For Jesse is a web based Chose Your Own Adventure game about reconnecting with a long lost friend. 
Play the game at: https://angelinapolidoro.github.io/LetterForJesse_CYOA/

This game was made as a project for my DIG2500 Fundamentals of Interactive Design class at the University of Central Florida in the fall of 2024. The coding (HTML and CSS), artwork, and writing were done by me. The only thing that was not created by me was the music on the first page of the game, which was created by hargissssound on freesound.org and is credited within the project. The skills I utelized for this project were: website creation, proficiency in HTML and CSS, story creation, narrative planning, and an understanding of interactive design. 

Navigation instructions are located inside the game, but for general reference: there is a home, about the game, and about the author button located on the footer of every page. Hit the "Play the game" button to start and progress by clicking on the green, bolded, underlined text within each page until you reach an ending. From there, simply use the footer to navigate back to the home page. 

I hope you enjoy the game and thank you for playing!
