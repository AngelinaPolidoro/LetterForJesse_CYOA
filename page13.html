<h3>A sentimental and melancholy letter.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        The words flow smoothly onto the paper, but each thought is grating and painful to actualize. When you step back to review your letter, you find it littered with teardrops. There’s a great sadness in you, but also relief. You could not imagine that writing this would be so lethargic, but it brings an unexpected finality to your struggle with the loss of Jesse. The feeling of embarrassment hits you again, maybe this is too cheesy and dramatic. <a href="page15.html"> You could send the letter </a>for a less daunting piece to send but with the same emotional punch.

        But maybe this is it. You needed to write this letter for you to let go, not for Jesse’s response. You could treat this letter as a physical manifestation of all those years of hanging on and <a href="page16.html"> destroy it once and for all </a>. Or Jesse hasn’t moved on either, maybe they need to read this too. A bit of calm washes over you as you imagine Jesse crying over the letter too, finally getting assurance that they are missed. The letter has many questions and insecurities, but the only way forward is to <a href="page14.html"> send it and get answers and reassurance from Jesse </a>.
