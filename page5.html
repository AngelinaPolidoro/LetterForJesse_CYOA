<h3>You decide to do something visual.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        Your first thought is a painting. Your second thought is something besides a gas station, perhaps something a little more “hang on the wall” friendly. Though what would bring the value of a hundred words into one drawing, what would be able to show your longingness? Your mind drifts, you stare off at your window and when you focus, your gaze lands on the plant on your window. It’s a Kalanchoe, and the final rays of the dusk sun illuminate it like a spotlight. The succulent’s leaves have soft, almost cartoonish bumps, and it has bloomed bundles of small red flowers. You got it from your grandmother four Christmases ago and you’ve meticulously kept it alive since then. You got it right after Jesse left actually, and it helped to keep you company for months. It’s something so simple, but the amount of times that you worked, laughed, and cried at your desk as the plant loomed over you on your windowsill makes it feel like it has witnessed your life since Jesse left. You think you have watercolors somewhere around here, and maybe you can capture the passing of time through <a href="page9.html"> a painting of this plant </a>.

        But your gaze goes back to the gas station image and the thought crosses your mind. Do you still have a receipt from there? Quickly you stand and run to your closet, you’ve been collecting little knick-knacks in an old storage bin for years which your family dubs the <i>“memory bin.”</i> Shuffling through bookmarks, kindergarten art projects, flyers, letters, and birthday cards you eventually find a crumpled pile of receipts. After scanning through the mess, you find a receipt for two cinnamon buns, the ones that were made in the local bakery and sent to the gas station and also the ones you and Jesse got every Friday to celebrate another weekend. You smile, there’s so much joy packed into a useless piece of trash like this. Maybe you don’t need to paint either, perhaps you already have all the pieces to <a href="page8.html"> a collage </a>, it just needs to be combined with a little bit of arrangement and a lot of glue.
