<h3>A collage of trash.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        There’s the slam and shuffle of papers and books as you rummage for materials. Then there’s the snip and tear of paper as you begin to cut. You found a children's magazine along the way, and you decide to glue the face of a clown from it onto your old principal’s face. You hope Jesse will get a kick out of that. There’s cut out words from the ticket of a carnival you and Jesse went to ever year, and it blends with crayoned lettering of an old birthday card. The gas station receipt is reunited with a handful of restaurant, aquarium, video game, and theme park receipts. You find a tiny plastic toy in the visage of a chicken; the coloring has faded, and the toy is of terrible quality. Jesse won that for you from a gumball machine when you first met, they gave it to you with the brightest smile. Maybe you could just glue it on somewhere. You make several drafts of how the collage should look, but eventually you just wing it, and come up with an endearing, albeit eclectic, collage. It is certainly an odd letter, but you think it holds so much emotional value. <a href="page14.html"> You could send it to Jesse </a>, and hope they find it as charming as you do.

        Though as you step back, a bit of fear hits you. While it may be emotional, maybe this is too abstract for a <i>“hey again, it’s been years since we talked”</i> kind of letter. Maybe this is just too weird in general, and anything more orthodox would do better than this. <a href="page15.html"> You can scrap the letter </a> and try again another day.
