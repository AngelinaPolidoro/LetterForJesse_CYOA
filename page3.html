        Pencil goes to paper, and a draft hastily forms onto the page. It's rough and full of emotion, flowing from you in semi-coherent sentences, but that allows you to write fast. Eventually you finish a paper, its front and back covered, instinctively picking up another. Your ideas get more and more sporadic, and they begin to trail into little blurbs or bullet points on the page. Finally, with several broken pencil leads and a small novel’s worth of writing later, you stand up and look at your drafts.

        Your eyes dart between the papers, and it's quite awkward reading all the writings. It almost feels as if someone is reading your thoughts, and it's all too personal and certainly too rash. But there is a clear divide in your words, on one hand you discuss the joys of your time together in a haze of nostalgia. It is comforting and inviting, perhaps the <a href="page6.html"> cheeriness is what you need to write about </a>. But on the other hand, your words are dreary and woeful, packed with years of unanswered questions. It isn’t as comfortable, but it’s definitely honest and maybe <a href="page7.html"> that's what you need to write about </a>.
