<h3>Keep it simple.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        Here’s the plan: write, revise, and condense. You end up forgetting about the large sheet of paper, and soon your desk is littered with colorful sticky notes. They are covered in little ideas, a first line, what you miss about them, your favorite diner, how that treehouse you made fell down, your new cat, and on and on. Some ideas run off the notes, either getting stuck to another note or having progressively smaller writing jammed on the back. You tried to color code them, but that idea stopped being implemented when the inspiration kicked in. The scene on your desk looks like a bunch of kids smacked open your brain like a pinata and all the ideas fell out like sticky note confetti.

        You're overthinking it, and you realize that as soon as you pick up one note urgently scribbled with a colored pen. It shows the rough draft of a poem, the words <i>“SIMPLE BUT DEEP”</i> are hastily written next to it. Jesse always liked poems, <a href="page4.html"> maybe that's a good idea</a>. Another note is stuck to the back, you peel it off to see an opposing, well, less of an idea and more a drawing. It is a small sketch of a gas station, specifically the one that you and Jesse used to hang out at after school. The memories of giggling over chips and soft drinks flood your mind and you start to think that maybe <a href="page5.html"> you don’t need a letter or words to convey your message at all</a>.
