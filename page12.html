<h3>A heartfelt and hopeful letter.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        You write and write, flowing with the ease of each happy memory. When you step back to review your letter, your mouth is strained from how wide your smile is. There’s love and emotion dripping from every word and the years you took for granted with Jesse seem even more sweet written out. You are proud of this letter, and you think when <a href="page14.html"> you send it </a> at the very least it will make Jesse smile.

        Or, perhaps, looking down at your bright work, this is all too whimsical. Even though it may be harsh, maybe Jesse would much rather have a serious letter than something that’s grasping at nostalgia. In retrospect, you think it might be offensive to treat this letter with such cheesy optimism. <a href="page15.html"> You can discard the letter </a>, trying a more serious approach.
