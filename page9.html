<h3>A watercolor painting.</h3>

        There’s a thunk as you put your watercolors, paper, and brushes onto the desk. Then there’s a slosh as you begin to wet the watercolors. Your eyes dart between the plant and the paper and you begin to hastily draw. Your first attempt is bad, the leaves are too large, the pot has streaks outside of the lines, and flowers have bled together into a big mess. But you grab another paper, trying again, and again, and again. Eventually, with your desk covered in stains and the plant burned into your head forever, you create a piece you can be proud of. It isn’t perfect, but there's a charm to it that makes you think it’s the one. It’s a letter, but one that doesn’t need words to show the emotion. It’s simple and sweet, and <a href="page14.html"> you can happily send it to Jesse </a>.

        But the plant painting reminds you of growth as well. The bloom of your potential and the start of a new life, different and scary, but new. Maybe you could portray this painting better in words? Perhaps a small poem, where the bloom of your plant equates to <a href="page10.html"> the bloom of spring </a>? Or, as you second guess the imperfect drawing and its ability to convey your message, you think <a href="page15.html"> you could scrap it and make another letter entirely with it </a>.
