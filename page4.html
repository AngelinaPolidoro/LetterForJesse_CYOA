<h3>You decide to write a poem.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        You shuffle through all the sticky notes you have, making a pile of the ones with particularly impactful and emotional sentiments. Some mention your fear of reconnecting, others your wish for closure. There are many ideas here, but you don’t know how to connect them. So, back to the drawing board. You shuffle around for some paper, writing down concepts and phenomena that you can relate back to your poem. The sun begins to take its final bow, its last rays peeking through your window as you lift your pencil. The paper mostly consists of bullet points, with the occasional note scribbled in the margins, and you soak in the ideas and consult your sticky notes. Despite the condensed form of your writing, you have so much to work with. <a href="page3.html"> You could write a long letter </a> with the sheer amount of talking points you have or you could stick to simple and short.

        But you’ve narrowed your notes down to two concepts. One talks about <a href="page10.html"> the bloom of spring </a>, the hope of a tree as it begins to flower, or the warming winds of a winter passed. There’s birth and hope, but it is new and uncertain and there is no promise that the plants that crumpled in the frost will rise with the same beauty in spring. The other talks about <a href="page11.html"> the chill of fall </a>, the creep of cold in the air and the shedding of the vibrant summer leaves. There’s death and loss, but nature prepares well for the loom of winter, and it will survive no matter the frost.
