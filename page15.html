<h3>Ending: Another crumpled paper.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        It’s done, all your hard work has culminated on this desk in front of you. Emotion and turmoil seep from it, barely contained in the parameters of a paper. It’s hard to look at, it almost embarrasses you to see how vulnerable it is. The butterflies in your stomach are rampant and a dread washes over you as you grab an envelope. Fear grabs hold of you, you don’t know if Jesse will like this or even want this. They left you then and maybe they’ll leave you again.

        But something sparks inside of you: terror.

        You do not know how Jesse lives or thinks after all this time, but you do know they will hate this. You spent all this time making something so filled with years of introspection but somehow it falls flat. It will never convey the emotions you want it to; all it conveys is an uncomfortably desperate ramble. Embarrassed, you crumple the paper, and toss it into your waste bin. If you can even write this letter, this is not how you want it to look. You slump out of your desk chair and go to sulk in your bed, you will try again another day.
