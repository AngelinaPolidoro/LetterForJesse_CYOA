<h3>Remember the bad times.</h3>

        You feel like the best approach for this is to start with questions. “Why” is an even better place to start. You understood that high school began to drag on the both of you, but when you saw the bright path to college, Jesse began to dread the end of childhood. Consultation and sympathy were all you could give, but you never really felt the crumble of your shared perspectives, interests, and futures. That was until you moved away for university, and while your texts were sparse, they quickly stopped to dead silence between you two. Why? Jesse never left a final text to tell you they were moving on or too busy, they just stopped replying to you. Why? There was no update from Jesse’s family about their life, work, school, anything. Why?

        Embarrassment hits you; this might be a bit too… much to give to Jesse. It’s going to be long and lamenting, and you think you can cut it down some into a more readable form. Your ideas include the dying of autumn and maybe you could try and condense it into a more metaphorical, but still <a href="page11.html"> emotional poem </a>. Or you could stick to your plan, keep the letter in its true form. You can show Jesse all your emotions and feelings, sending them the <a href="page13.html"> brutally honest letter</a>.
