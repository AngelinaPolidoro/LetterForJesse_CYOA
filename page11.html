<h3>A somber sonnet.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        You choose your words carefully, with analogies of birds migrating and promises of harvest. The bittersweet undertone of the poem is like the loom of winter. You know your poem is effective because you feel its effects hit you. The flight of dried, dulled leaves in fall still echoes through your head. But you might want something more literal, the play on emotions is nice but it could be more effective if you communicate in normal language. <a href="page15.html"> You could scrap the tragic poem </a>and try again another day.

        An existential dread hits you, and the fleeting transition of fall reminds you of how precious the time you have is. The sudden urge to take action seizes you and a thought enters your mind. Maybe you could skip sending the letter, it could take forever to get to Jesse and perhaps it cannot convey your true intentions. You could pack up and start driving to Jesseâ€™s house tomorrow, and <a href="page17.html"> you can show up with your letter </a>in hand and so much more to say. Or space might be what Jesse needs. <a href="page14.html"> You could send the letter </a>and let the dread of waiting, like the inevitable winter, pass and patiently wait for the sweetness of a response.
