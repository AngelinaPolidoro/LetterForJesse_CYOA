<h3>A happy haiku.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        It takes considerable effort to write something so short, but the end result seems worth it. You write of the awakening flowers of the new year and the hope for sunny days. There’s a lovely undertone to it that is as calming as the showers of spring. You know your poem is effective because you feel its effects hit you. The sweet melody of songbirds in the spring air still dances through your mind. But you might want something more literal, the play on emotions is nice but it could be more effective if you communicate in normal language. <a href="page15.html"> You could scrap the joyous poem and try again another day </a>.

        Though, an odd dread rushes through you that reminds you of the past and future loss that surrounds the spring. The sudden urge to take action seizes you and a thought enters your mind. Maybe you could skip sending the letter, it could take forever to get to Jesse and perhaps it cannot convey your true intentions. You could pack up and start driving to Jesse’s house tomorrow, and <a href="page17.html"> you can show up with your letter </a>in hand and so much more to say. Or space might be what Jesse needs. <a href="page14.html"> You could send the letter </a>and let go of the fear of losing, like the loss that brought the spring and will bring the next pass and patiently wait for the sweetness of a response.
