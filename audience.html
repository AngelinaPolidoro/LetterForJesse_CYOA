<h2>About the Game</h2>
<section>
    <p>
        There is something so painful about becoming estranged with a beloved friend. It is not the kind of pain of ripping a band aid off, or the kind of pain you know will heal quickly. It creeps up slowly over months or years until it breaks, and the loss of it is intangible before it happens but crippling afterwards. There is something even more painful in trying to figure out why it happened.
