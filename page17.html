<h3>Ending: A personal delivery.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        That’s it! You must see Jesse. A giddy feeling buzzes through your whole body and you can’t tell if you’re more excited or nervous. It’s impulsive, yes, but as you frantically grab your suitcase you suddenly can’t imagine telling Jesse your feelings any other way. You carefully pack your message into a folder before haphazardly tossing your clothes and toiletries into your suitcase. The letter is nice, but there will be no need to put anything onto paper when you will tell it all to Jesse yourself. As you pack you remember a conversation you and Jesse had back in high school; you were going to a college fair, and you were cripplingly nervous to do anything but hover.

        You remember Jesse laughing at you, telling you to get out there and do it, no matter the fear or embarrassment. You think you’ll tell that story when you see them again.
