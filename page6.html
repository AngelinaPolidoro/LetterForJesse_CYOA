<h3>Remember the good times.</h3>

<section>
    <p>
        While there’s so much to ask and so much turmoil to shuffle through, you think throwing a negative letter at Jesse will only do harm. It also feels like you would somehow be blaming Jesse, treating the letter like an accusatory outlash rather than an olive branch. You think that finding some fond memories would be a good start. It doesn’t take long to wrack your brains for memories, you think of the summer and days on the beach. There’s the crash of waves and the glare of the sun as you and Jesse tumble through the water in delight. You then remember begrudgingly returning to school in the fall, feeling the frost of incoming winter on the jungle gym bars and the wind as you and Jesse sat on the swings. Wait. The soft memories of school bring you to your feet. You have your yearbooks somewhere, hidden away in the crevices of your room. After some searching you find a whole stack of them, they span from your bright eyed, front tooth missing kindergarten years to your pimple covered, awkward preteen years. It’s a jackpot of memories as you flip through the pages, and you hope you can <a href="page12.html"> convey the fondness you feel onto your letter </a>.

        Though, as you look back at your smiling faces in the yearbook in your hands the thought crosses your mind. How many memories do you have like that? Squished in between pages or crumpled in folders, simple objects that hold the memory better than your words. Maybe you could cut and collage your yearbook, letter, and other memories, making <a href="page8.html"> a message of images instead </a>?
